Apple //ix was originally developed as the "apple2-emul-linux" package.

Alexander Jean-Claude Bottema <alexb@csd.uu.se> made the original version of the
emulator in 1994. 

Stephen Lee <sl14@cornell.edu> contributed early work on the emulator.

Michael Deutschmann <michael@talamasca.ocis.net> cleaned up the build sequence
to use standard GNU tools.

Tom Lear <tom@trap.mtview.ca.us> maintained a Debian package of  this program,
and has contributed some fixes.

Aaron Culliney contributed to early versions of this emulator, and picked up
development again in 2012.

In addition we are indebted to Tom Charlesworth from the AppleWin emulator
project.  AppleWin is free software for the Windows platform.
