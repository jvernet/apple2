Alexander Jean-Claude Bottema <alexb@csd.uu.se> made the original 
version of the emulator in 1994. 

Stephen Lee <sl14@cornell.edu> and particularly Aaron Culliney 
<asc@mhpcc.edu> have done much work on the emulator since.

Michael Deutschmann <michael@talamasca.ocis.net> cleaned up the 
build sequence to use standard GNU tools, and is the present coordinator.

Tom Lear <tom@trap.mtview.ca.us> maintains the Debian package of  
this program, and has contributed some fixes.
