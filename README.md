WIP : a salvaged Apple ][+ //e emulator

Important TODO in no particular order:
    * synching to the normal 1MHz speed
    * Separate audio and render threads
    * Build to different frontends: improve X11, SDL, OpenGL?, etc...
    * A proper build system
    * Convert x86/32 assembly routines to C
    * Generate ARM assembly if needed
    * Improved interfaces/menus
