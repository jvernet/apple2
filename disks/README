Sample Disk Images
------ ---- ------

These disk images are merely distributed with the emulator and are not 
actually part of it. (ie: not subject to GPL, and not written by us.)

Many more disk images (including ones we'd never include here due to 
copyright considerations) may be found on ftp.apple.asimov.net.
