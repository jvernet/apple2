                The Apple //e computer shipped with a 1-bit speaker that programs could toggle in realtime to create a
                square wave.  This allowed some primitive forms of "music" and sound-effects in games.  This emulator
                supports this speaker, although with a slight delay due to modern-day soundcard buffering.

                <p class="p">
                In addition to a 1-bit speaker, you could install various after-market sound cards in the Apple //e
                computer.  This emulator currently emulates a Mockingboard Revision "C" board installed both in Slot 4
                and Slot 5.  Future versions of the emulator will make this configurable.  Some games can make use of
                this emulated hardware.
