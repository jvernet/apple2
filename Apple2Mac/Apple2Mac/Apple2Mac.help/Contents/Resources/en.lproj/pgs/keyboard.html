                Apple2Mac emulates a US ASCII keyboard layout that came standard with the Apple //e machine shipped in
                the United States in the '80s.  This keyboard generated both upper and lowercase ASCII input.
                </p>

                <p class="p">
                <b>NOTE:</b> many Apple //e games were also designed to work with the older non-enhanced Apple ][+
                machine which only allowed upper-case keyboard input (and also did not have up/down arrow keys).  If a
                game does not respond to typing, make sure you have <b>CAPSLOCK on</b>.
                </p>

                <p class="p">
                <b>NOTE:</b> Some games required you to press the K key (or Ctrl-K) to engage keyboard input.  Similarly
                if you desired to use the Joystick (including the Apple2Mac emulated keypad joystick) you would press a
                'J' (or Ctrl-J).  
                </p>

                For those of you who do not remember the '80s&mdash;lookin' at you Millenials!&mdash;there were
                a few keyboard "standards" that you could expect a game to honor (if playing via keyboard and not
                joystick).  Some games allowed in-game key configuration, but others:
                <ul>
                    <li>Up/down/left/right arrow keys<li>
                    <li>A, Z, and left/right arrows</li>
                    <li>I, J, K, M</li>
                    <li>W, A, D, X</li>
                    <li>I, J, K, L</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2 class="title topictitle2">Joystick keyboard buttons</h2>
                <p class="p">
                The Apple //e keyboard had an OpenApple and ClosedApple key which doubled as Joystick button 1 and 2.
                These are emulated by your left and right ALT keys, respectively.
