                Disk images are files on your computer that were converted from the floppy disks that you originally
                used with the Apple //e.  The Apple //e computer usually came with 2 disk drives (A &amp; B) that were
                connected in slot 6 on the motherboard.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                Apple2Mac can read and write disk images in DOS-order (file extensions of .dsk and .do) or disk images
                that are raw nibble-encoded (file extension .nib).  In the disk selection window you can specify whether
                they are inserted read-only or read+write in either disk drive A or drive B.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title topictitle2">Procuring Disk Images</h2>
                <p class="p">
                Disk images can be procured from various online sources.  In particular, you can use anonymous FTP to
                the Apple2 archive at <a class="xref" href="ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/" target="_blank">ftp.apple.asimov.net</a>.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title topictitle2">Troubleshooting Disk Images</h2>
                <p class="p">
                If you have a disk image that appears problematic, (won't boot or errors out), it may be one of several things:
                <ul>
                    <li>You have "inserted" the disk in a read-only mode, and you are attempting to write information to
                    that disk.  Usually the game or app will complain if it needs write access, but not always.  Open
                    the disks dialog and select read/write status for that disk image file.</li>
                    <li>The disk image itself is corrupted.  If you suspect Apple2Mac is reponsible, please <a
                        href="https://github.com/mauiaaron/apple2/issues/">file an issue report on Github</a>.</li>
                    <li>There is a bug in the emulator.  Check the <a href="https://github.com/mauiaaron/apple2/issues/">Github
                        issues page</a> to see the status of known issues.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                Some games make use of both disk drives, but only if something was inserted into the second disk drive.
                For example you might load the "boot" disk in drive A, and the "player" disk in drive B before rebooting
                the emulator.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title topictitle2">More Disk Image Info</h2>
                <p class="p">
                Disk images are binary files that actually are raw dumps of the original 5.25" disk. A disk image will
                contain all tracks from 0 to 34.  For the standard 143360 byte .dsk format each track is partitioned
                into sectors numbered from 0 to 15.  Each sector is 256 bytes.
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                Emulated diskettes MUST have the .dsk or .nib extension (143360 bytes or 232960 bytes respectively),
                otherwise the emulator will not recognize the file as a valid diskette.  However, it is valid to
                compress them by using gzip (then the extension becomes .dsk.gz or .nib.gz). The emulator will
                automatically decompress/compress them whenever required.
