Obviously this emulator could use extension.  We could do with support
for more disk-image formats, additional interface cards, memory-image
save/restore, and other things. 

However, most of these things would require hooking into parts of the code
that are likely going to change radically in later versions of the
emulator, due to badly needed cleanups.  Thus, I do not recommend trying
to extend this version alone. 

If you want to work on the emulator, contact us first.  We can give you alpha
versions of the emulator to work on, and coordinate your efforts with
other contributors.
